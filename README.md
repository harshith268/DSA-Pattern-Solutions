# DSA Pattern Solutions (Java & Python)

This repository contains **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems solved
in a **pattern / topic-wise** manner using **Java** and **Python**.

The goal of this repository is:
- ✅ To build strong **DSA fundamentals**
- ✅ To prepare for **product-based company interviews** (Amazon, etc.)
- ✅ To provide a **clean learning resource** for others
- ✅ To include **Brute Force → Better → Optimal** approaches wherever applicable



## 🧠 How This Repository is Organized

- Problems are grouped **pattern-wise** (Stack, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, etc.)
- Each pattern folder contains:
  - 📄 `README.md` → list of problems in tabular format
  - ☕ `java/` → Java solutions
  - 🐍 `python/` → Python solutions
- Each problem solution includes:
  - Brute Force approach (when meaningful)
  - Better/Optimized approach (if applicable)
  - Final Optimal approach
  - Time & Space Complexity analysis (in comments)



## ✅ How to Use This Repository

1. Click `dsa/`
2. Select a **pattern** (e.g. Stack)
3. Choose a problem
4. Open **Java or Python** solution
5. Understand the progression from **Brute → Optimal**

## 📌 Note

This repository is intended for **learning and revision**.  
Readers are encouraged to **try solving the problem first** before checking solutions.
